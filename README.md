# Project Title: Stabilization of Interdependent Networks with Two Sub-networks of Non-identical Nodes

## Overview

This repository contains MATLAB code and associated figures for the research paper titled **"Stabilization of interdependent networks with two sub-networks of non-identical nodes"**. The core of this project is a `main.m` script that simulates and visualizes the stabilization process of interdependent networks. The outputs of the simulations are saved as `.fig` files, allowing for post-analysis and visualization of results.
